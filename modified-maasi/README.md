# Modified Maasi Spin Coater

Source code and documentation for a modified version of the [Maasi](https://github.com/klotzsch-lab/Maasi) spin coater.

The modified spin coater is a standin for a more permanent design,
so it does not have a complete schematic or CAD.

## Building

The source code can be uploaded to an Arduino Nano Every using the Arduino IDE.
It only depends on the
[Servo](https://docs.arduino.cc/libraries/servo/) and 
[LiquidCrystal](https://docs.arduino.cc/libraries/liquidcrystal/) libraries.
